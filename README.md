## Platform overview

* A management system with front-end and back-end separation developed based on the Go Frame 2.0+Vue3+Element Plus
* The front-end uses vue-next-admin, Vue, and Element UI.

## Features

* High productivity: a backend management system can be built in a few minutes
* Modularity: a single application with multiple systems, which divides a complete application into multiple systems for easier expansion and increased code reuse.
* Authentication mechanism: adopts gtoken user status authentication and casbin authorization
* Routing mode: thanks to goframe2.0, which provides a standardized routing registration method, automatic API documentation is generated without annotations
* Interface-oriented development
* Supports object models, multi-product, and multi-device access and management.
* Blurs the complexity of network protocols, adapts to multiple access protocols (TCP, MQTT, UDP, CoAP, HTTP, gRPC, RPC, etc.), and flexibly connects to devices from different manufacturers.
* Supports cross-platform operation, can quickly implement edge computing functions, realize offline automatic alerts, and automatic execution.
* Supports cross-terminal display, can monitor device status and display data through PC, mobile phone, and tablet.
* Unique plugin system, supports cross-language access, can be quickly accessed through plugins written in C/C++, Python.
* The plugin system supports hot-plugging, supports Modbus tcp, modbus rtu, modbus ascii, iec61850, opc, and other data acquisition protocols.
